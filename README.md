Welcome to Creeper Party! In this repository you can find the source code of the game 'creeper party'. It is a game fully developed in java. The goal of the game is to survive as a creeper. You will have to go through a lot of minigames in order to survive. There will also be a shop in which you can buy different powerups. I wish you all the luck in the life as a creeper!
